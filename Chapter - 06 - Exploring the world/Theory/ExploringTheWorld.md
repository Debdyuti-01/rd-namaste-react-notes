### Q: What is `Microservice`?
A: A `Microservice` is a software architectural style that structures an application as a collection of small, independent, and loosely coupled services. Each service in a microservices architecture is designed to perform a specific, well-defined function and can run as an independent process. These services communicate with each other through well-defined APIs (typically over HTTP or other lightweight protocols) and often make use of data storage systems and other infrastructure components.

Key characteristics of microservices include:

`Decomposition` - In a microservices architecture, a monolithic application is decomposed into multiple smaller services. Each service is responsible for a specific aspect of the application's functionality. For example, one service might handle user authentication, while another manages product catalog information.

`Independence` - Each microservice is independent and has its codebase, database, and often its technology stack. This independence allows teams to develop, deploy, and scale individual services without affecting the entire application.

`Loose Coupling` - Microservices communicate with each other through well-defined APIs or contracts, which enables loose coupling. This means that changes to one service should not impact other services as long as the API contract remains stable.

`Scalability` - Microservices can be scaled independently. Services that experience higher demand can be scaled out, while others can remain unchanged. This provides efficient resource allocation.

`Flexibility` - Microservices are well-suited for applications that require flexibility. Developers can use different technologies and programming languages for different services, allowing them to choose the best tool for the job.

`Resilience` - Microservices are designed to be resilient. If one service fails, it should not bring down the entire application. Redundancy and failover mechanisms can be implemented.

`Continuous Deployment` - Microservices make it easier to implement continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) practices, as individual services can be deployed and updated independently.

`Ownership` - Teams can take ownership of specific microservices, making it easier to assign responsibility for different parts of the application.

`Microservices` architectures are often used in large and complex applications, such as e-commerce platforms, social media networks, and financial systems, where the ability to scale and maintain individual parts of the system is crucial. However, they also introduce challenges, such as managing inter-service communication, data consistency, and the increased complexity of deployment and monitoring. Proper design, tooling, and best practices are essential to realizing the benefits of a microservices architecture while addressing its challenges.

### Q: What is `Monolith architecture`?
A: A `monolithic` architecture, also known as a monolithic application, is a traditional software architectural style in which an entire application is built as a single, self-contained unit. In a monolithic architecture, all components and functionalities of the application, such as user interfaces, business logic, and data access, are tightly integrated and packaged together. This contrasts with microservices architecture, where the application is decomposed into a collection of small, independent services.

Key characteristics of a monolithic architecture include:

`Single Codebase` - In a monolithic application, all the code for different application parts is typically written in the same codebase. This codebase can be organized into different modules or packages, but it's all part of the same project.

`Tight Coupling` - Components and modules within a monolithic application are tightly coupled, meaning they often depend on each other. Changes to one part of the application can have ripple effects on other parts, making it harder to isolate and maintain individual features.

`Single Deployment Unit` - The entire application is deployed as a single unit. When updates or changes are made, the entire monolith must be redeployed. This can lead to longer deployment cycles and increased risk.

`Scaling Challenges` - Scaling a monolithic application can be challenging. If one part of the application requires more resources to handle increased load, the entire application must be scaled, which can be inefficient.

`Technology Stack` - In a monolithic architecture, the entire application typically uses the same technology stack, programming language, and frameworks. This limits the flexibility to use different technologies for different parts of the application.

`Development Team Structure` - Monolithic applications often have development teams working on different features, but all within the same codebase. Teams need to coordinate closely to avoid conflicts and to ensure changes do not disrupt other parts of the application.

`Testing and Debugging` - Testing and debugging a monolithic application can be complex, as changes can impact various parts of the application. Comprehensive testing is required to ensure that updates do not introduce bugs or break existing functionality.

`Resource Allocation` - All resources, such as databases and servers, are shared among the components of the monolith, which can lead to resource contention and performance issues.

Monolithic architectures are a common choice for smaller applications and for projects where simplicity and speed of development are prioritized. However, as applications grow in complexity and scale, monolithic architectures can become less maintainable and harder to evolve. This has led to the adoption of alternative architectures like microservices, which decompose the application into smaller, more manageable components.

### Q: What is the difference between `Monolith` and `Microservice`?
A: 
| Characteristics | Monolithic Architecture | Microservice Architecture |
| :--- | :--- | ---: |
| Architecture | Single, self-contained application | Collection of small, independent services | 
| Codebase | Single codebase for the entire application | Multiple codebases for individual services | 
| Coupling	| Tight coupling between components | Loose coupling between services | 
| Deployment Unit | Single deployment unit | Individual service deployment |
| Scalability | Application scaled as a whole | Services scaled independently | 
| Technology Stack | Single technology stack for the entire application | Flexibility to use different technologies for each service | 
| Development Teams | Single development team working on the same codebase | Teams can own and develop individual services | 
| Testing and Debugging | Complex testing and debugging due to tight integration | Easier testing and debugging of isolated services |
| Resource Allocation | Shared resources among all components | More efficient resource allocation for individual services |
| Deployment | Slower deployment cycles due to the need to redeploy the entire monolith | Faster and more frequent deployments of individual services |
| Change Impact | Changes can impact other parts of the application | Changes are isolated and have limited impact |
| Complexity | Simpler for small applications but can become complex as the application grows | Suitable for complex applications but introduces its own challenges |

### Q: Why do we need `useEffect Hook`?
A: The `useEffect` hook is an essential part of React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. `It's used to manage side effects in functional components`. Side effects are actions that occur outside the normal flow of a React component, such as `data fetching`, `DOM manipulation`, and `subscribing to external data sources`.

Here are several reasons why the useEffect hook is necessary:

`Data Fetching` - In many applications, we need to fetch data from external sources, like an API, when a component is rendered. The useEffect hook allows us to perform these data-fetching operations after the initial rendering.

`DOM Manipulation` - Sometimes, we may need to interact with the Document Object Model (DOM) directly. For instance, we might want to update the title of a webpage or manipulate the size and position of DOM elements. useEffect is used for these purposes.

`Subscriptions` - If our component needs to subscribe to external events, like `WebSocket connections` or `real-time updates from a server`, useEffect is a suitable place to `manage and clean up these subscriptions`.

`Lifecycle Events` - React components have lifecycles, and useEffect allows us to perform actions at specific points in a component's lifecycle. We can control when code is executed, such as when the component mounts, updates, or unmounts.

`Avoiding Memory Leaks` - Using useEffect, we can ensure that any `resources or event listeners we create in a component are cleaned up when the component is unmounted`. This helps prevent `memory leaks and ensures our application runs efficiently`.

`Conditional Effects` - We can use useEffect with dependencies to run code conditionally when certain values change. This allows us to react to changes in state or props and execute side effects accordingly.

`Separation of Concerns` - The useEffect hook promotes a more organized and maintainable code structure by separating the logic for side effects from the rendering logic within a component.

Here's a basic example of how useEffect is used to fetch data:

```
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    // This code will run after the component is mounted.
    // You can fetch data here and update the state when it's available.
    fetchData()
      .then((result) => setData(result))
      .catch((error) => console.error(error));
  }, []); // Empty dependency array means this effect runs once after the initial render.

  return (
    <div>
      {data ? (
        <p>Data: {data}</p>
      ) : (
        <p>Loading data...</p>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}

export default MyComponent;
```

In this example, the useEffect hook is used to fetch data when the component is mounted, ensuring that the side effect of data fetching occurs at the appropriate time in the component's lifecycle.
